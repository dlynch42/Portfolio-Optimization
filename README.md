# Portfolio Optimization
Using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and MatPlotLib, I was able to grab a combination of 12 stock tickers' chart data, set the portfolio allocation percentage, and track the performance of both the individual stocks as well as the entire portfolio. I then plotted a Sharpe Ratio and a Marcowitz Portfolio Optimization Model to visualize the risk to return.
